# HQEC–Omega v7.1.1-HIL

**High-Quality Expansion Cosmology with Hierarchical Independent Likelihoods**  
Separation of FRW geometry, teleonomic tilt measure, and HIL calibration with a guaranteed fixed-point solution for falsifiable \(H_0\)-tension decomposition.

---

## Description
HQEC–Omega v7.1.1-HIL cleanly separates:
- **Geometry**: FRW background
- **Measure**: \(w(z) = e^{\eta_1 z + \eta_2 z^2}\)
- **Calibration**: Hierarchical Independent Likelihood (HIL)

A 7-map contraction (\(L = 0.689 < 1\)) guarantees a unique fixed point, enabling pre-registered and falsifiable \(H_0\)-tension decomposition. Results are testable via DESI, CMB-S4, and GW standard sirens.

## Features
**Strict separation** of geometry, measure, and calibration  
**Mathematical guarantee** of convergence (Banach fixed-point theorem)  
**Reproducible constraints** with pre-registration  
**Ready for observational tests** (DESI, CMB-S4, GW)
