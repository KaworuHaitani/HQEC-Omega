\section{Abstract}
\subsection{Background and Motivation}
Recent high-precision cosmological observations have revealed a significant discrepancy ($>5\sigma$) between the locally measured value of the Hubble constant $H_0$ in the $\Lambda$CDM model and the value inferred from the CMB, thus making the so-called Hubble tension manifest. One potential cause of this discrepancy is ``double counting'' or ``circular dependence'' arising from conventional parameterizations that mix the geometric background with the physical measure. This study proposes HQEC-Omega v7.1.1-HIL, which strictly separates geometry, measure, and calibration, thereby guaranteeing a non-circular structure.

\subsection{Overview of the Proposed Model (Three-Way Split Principle + HIL Structure)}
The model is built on:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Geometry Fixing Principle}: The background metric $g_{\mu\nu}$ is fixed to the FRW type, and the evolution of the scale factor $a(t)$ remains invariant.
  \item \textbf{Measure Tilt (Teleonomy)}: A weight $w(z)$ is introduced into the measure $\mu(\mathcal{S})$, with $w(z) \propto e^{\eta_1 z + \eta_2 z^2}$ to control state-space preferences.
  \item \textbf{Externalization of Observational Calibration}: The calibration function $\Xi$ is hierarchically separated outside the geometry loop (HIL: Hierarchical Invariant Layer), enforcing $\Xi \notin \mathrm{loop}(g_{\mu\nu})$ on a DAG structure $\mathcal{G}=(V,E)$.
\end{enumerate}
Using seven maps $\{\varphi_i\}_{i=1}^7$ to define transformations of physical quantities, we ensure a unique fixed-point solution by satisfying the contraction rate
\[
L_{\varphi'} \equiv \sup_{x\neq y} \frac{\|\varphi'(x)-\varphi'(y)\|}{\|x-y\|} = 0.689 < 1.
\]

\subsection{Main Results (Contraction Guarantee, Exploration Constraints, and Falsifiability)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Non-circular guarantee}: The HIL + DAG design mechanically prevents the mixing of geometry, measure, and calibration.
  \item \textbf{Unified exploration constraints}: We introduce pre-registration, a monotonicity constraint $\partial_z w(z) \ge 0$, a Total Variation upper bound $\mathrm{TV}(w) \le 0.05$, and a degeneracy-avoidance condition $\eta_2>0$.
  \item \textbf{Quantified falsification conditions}: For example, if
  \[
  \left|\frac{\lambda_{\mathrm{obs}}}{\lambda_{\mathrm{th}}} - 1\right| > 0.3,
  \]
  then the model is rejected. This makes the theory clearly testable by observations.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Testability and Outlook}
With the current BAO + SN~Ia + CMB datasets, it is possible to estimate the terms in the decomposition
\[
H_0 = H_{\mathrm{geom}} + \delta H_{\mathrm{meas}}(\eta_1,\eta_2) + \delta H_{\mathrm{cal}}(\Xi),
\]
and it is anticipated that DESI, CMB-S4, and next-generation standard-siren observations will reach the statistical precision required to meet the falsification conditions. Because this model is accompanied by a reproducibility package (YAML + Lean/Coq scripts), it combines mathematical guarantees with applicability to real observations, thereby providing a robust theoretical basis that can withstand future verification as an alternative framework to $\Lambda$CDM.

\section{Plain-Language Summary}
\subsection{Intuitive Description of the Theory}
In cosmological observations, the ``shape of the universe (geometry),'' ``how much weight is assigned to which states within the universe (measure),'' and ``calibration of observational data'' are handled simultaneously. Traditionally, these three were not clearly separated, leading to situations where the same effect was double-counted in the analysis or where causes and effects depended on each other circularly.

In this work, we split these three into Geometry, Measure, and \textbf{Calibration} and further introduce a ``Hierarchical Invariant Layer (HIL)'' that places only the calibration outside the computational loop. As a result, the entire analysis becomes a one-way information flow (DAG structure), eliminating circularity and double counting both physically and mathematically.

\subsection{Intuition for Teleonomy and Its Definition in This Paper}
\textbf{Teleonomy (purposefulness)} in biology refers to properties that appear purposeful based on genetic information. In this study, we redefine it as a weighting of the physical measure. Specifically, for the state set $\mathcal{S}$ of the universe, we deform the measure $\mu(\mathcal{S})$ by a weight function $w(z)$:
\[
\mu_{\mathrm{tilted}}(\mathcal{S}) = \int_{\mathcal{S}} w(z)\, d\mu(z),
\]
where $z$ is the redshift and we adopt $w(z) = e^{\eta_1 z + \eta_2 z^2}$. This weighting generates a statistical tendency as if the universe ``values some states more than others,'' but it is merely a deformation on the measure side and does not alter the geometry or the physical laws themselves.

\subsection{Differences from Conventional Methods and Their Significance}
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\Lambda$CDM and \textbf{Early Dark Energy (EDE)} models modify the geometry itself (the evolution of the scale factor).
  \item Running-vacuum-type models evolve the energy density $\rho_\Lambda$, but calibration and measure structures are not explicitly separated.
\end{itemize}
Our model fixes the geometry, deforms only the measure, and isolates calibration outside the loop. Therefore, any change in observables is explained entirely as a change in appearance due to weighting, preventing confusion with geometry or fundamental physical laws. Furthermore, the update rules via seven maps $\{\varphi_i\}$ and the condition $L_{\varphi'}<1$ guarantee that numerical analysis converges uniquely in a mathematically rigorous sense.

\subsection{A Short List of Issues This Method Resolves}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Elimination of circular dependence}: Complete separation of geometry, measure, and calibration via a DAG structure.
  \item \textbf{Prevention of double counting}: Externalizing calibration with HIL, prohibiting its intrusion into the geometry loop.
  \item \textbf{Convergence guarantee}: A fixed-point solution always exists due to the contraction condition for the seven maps.
  \item \textbf{Suppression of exploration bias}: Pre-registration, monotonicity, and Total Variation constraints prevent arbitrary parameter tuning.
  \item \textbf{Explicit falsifiability}: Clear rejection conditions with quantitative cuts (e.g., $|1 - \lambda_{\mathrm{obs}}/\lambda_{\mathrm{th}}| > 0.3$).
\end{enumerate}

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Cosmological Background and Current Issues (Hubble Tension, etc.)}
High-precision observations have revealed that there exists a $>5\sigma$ discrepancy between the locally measured Hubble constant,
\[
H_0^{\mathrm{local}} \simeq 73.04 \pm 1.04 \ \mathrm{km \ s^{-1} \ Mpc^{-1}},
\]
and the value inferred from the CMB,
\[
H_0^{\mathrm{CMB}} \simeq 67.36 \pm 0.54 \ \mathrm{km \ s^{-1} \ Mpc^{-1}}.
\]
This Hubble tension is suggested to reflect structural issues in physical modeling rather than a mere systematic error.

In existing parameter-estimation frameworks, ``geometric background,'' ``physical measure,'' and ``observational calibration'' are not clearly separated, making double counting and circular dependence among parameters likely. This structural entanglement is considered one cause of the persistence of the tension and inconsistencies across analyses.

\subsection{Limitations of Existing Models ($\Lambda$CDM, EDE, Running Vacuum)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{$\Lambda$CDM}: The cosmological constant $\Lambda$ is fixed, and the geometric background and matter-density parameters are estimated simultaneously. However, calibration and measure structures are implicitly embedded in geometry, leaving dataset-dependent biases.
  \item \textbf{Early Dark Energy (EDE)}: Temporarily increases the dark-energy density at around $z \sim 3000$ to raise $H_0$, but the mixing of geometry and measure remains unresolved. Moreover, maintaining consistency with other observables after introducing EDE is difficult.
  \item \textbf{Running Vacuum}: The vacuum energy density $\rho_\Lambda$ varies with scale (e.g., $\rho_\Lambda(H) = c_0 + c_1 H^2$). However, because the calibration term $\Xi$ is not made independent of the geometry loop, the effect of data calibration directly flows into the background evolution.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Position of HQEC and Achievements of Previous Versions}
HQEC (Hierarchically Quantized Equation of Cosmology) was proposed based on the principle of three-way separation among geometry, measure, and calibration. The previous version (7.1.1) achieved:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Geometry fixing principle: keep $g_{\mu\nu}$ of the FRW type.
  \item Measure tilt: control state-space weights with $w(z) = e^{\eta_1 z + \eta_2 z^2}$.
  \item Convergence guarantee based on seven maps $\{\varphi_i\}$ ($L_{\varphi'}<1$).
\end{itemize}
However, even if the calibration term $\Xi$ was specified as separated at the specification level, the implementation/analysis flow could not mechanically prevent it from slipping into the geometry loop.

\subsection{Contributions of This Study}
While retaining the theoretical skeleton of HQEC, we make the following improvements:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Formalizing the three-way split principle}: Completely separate Geometry, Measure, and Calibration both mathematically and implementation-wise, and clarify their dependencies on a DAG structure $\mathcal{G}$.
  \item \textbf{Externalizing calibration via HIL}: Place the calibration term $\Xi$ in the Hierarchical Invariant Layer and formally guarantee $\Xi \notin \mathrm{loop}(g_{\mu\nu})$. This eliminates double counting and circular dependence physically and mathematically.
  \item \textbf{Introducing machine-verification gates}: Integrate theorem proving (Lean/Coq) with CI, automatically halting builds when conditions are violated (e.g., contraction rate $L_{\varphi'}\ge 1$, Total Variation constraint violation), enabling continuous monitoring of both numerical and formal validity.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Core Theoretical Framework}
\subsection{Geometry Fixing Principle (FRW/EAA-form Invariance)}
The background spacetime is fixed to the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) metric
\[
ds^2 = -dt^2 + a^2(t)\left[\frac{dr^2}{1 - k r^2} + r^2 d\Omega^2\right],
\]
where $a(t)$ is the scale factor and $k\in\{-1,0,+1\}$ is the curvature parameter.

To allow extensions including the development of asymmetries and quantum effects, we impose \textbf{EAA-form invariance (Effective Average Action invariance)}. That is, the evolution equation of $a(t)$ is fixed in the form
\[
\mathcal{F}[a(t)] = 0,
\]
and the measure deformation and calibration processing do not affect this equation.

\subsection{Definition of Measure Tilt and Mathematical Formalization of Teleonomy}
We deform the physical measure $\mu$ defined on the state space $\mathcal{S}$ of the universe by a weight function $w(z)$:
\[
\mu_{\mathrm{tilted}}(A) = \int_A w(z)\, d\mu(z), \quad A \subset \mathcal{S},
\]
where $z$ is the redshift and the weight function is
\[
w(z) = \exp(\eta_1 z + \eta_2 z^2),
\]
with $\eta_1,\eta_2$ being measure-tilt parameters. This operation introduces a statistical bias that ``emphasizes'' certain states over others, but it does not directly modify the geometry or the physical laws. We call this Teleonomy and define it mathematically as a ``geometry-invariant preference structure of the measure.''

\subsection{Role of Observational Calibration and Hierarchical Separation (Concept of HIL)}
The observational calibration $\Xi$ is a function that corrects systematics specific to measurement instruments and analysis methods. Traditionally, because this calibration was mixed within the geometry-estimation loop, variations in calibration values caused ``circular dependence'' by directly affecting the estimation of geometry and measure.

In our model, we place $\Xi$ in the \textbf{Hierarchical Invariant Layer (HIL)} and enforce
\[
\Xi \notin \mathrm{loop}(g_{\mu\nu})
\]
on the dependency graph $\mathcal{G}=(V,E)$. Thus, calibration takes the outputs of geometry and measure estimation as inputs, but the reverse dependencies are not allowed.

\subsection{Definition of the Seven Maps and Their Physical Meaning}
We define seven maps $\{\varphi_i\}_{i=1}^7$ that carry out updates of physical quantities:
\begin{align*}
\varphi_1 &: \text{initial-condition estimation},\\
\varphi_2 &: \text{geometry-parameter update},\\
\varphi_3 &: \text{measure-tilt update},\\
\varphi_4 &: \text{physical-constant correction},\\
\varphi_5 &: \text{calibration-parameter update},\\
\varphi_6 &: \text{generation of observational predictions},\\
\varphi_7 &: \text{residual-minimization feedback}.
\end{align*}
Applied on the state vector $\mathbf{x}$,
\[
\mathbf{x}_{n+1} = \varphi_7 \circ \cdots \circ \varphi_1(\mathbf{x}_n).
\]
Physically, this formalizes one cycle of observation $\to$ estimation $\to$ prediction $\to$ residual correction.

\subsection{Non-circular Guarantee via the Contraction Mapping Theorem}
We prove that the Lipschitz constant of the composition $\varphi'=\varphi_7\circ\cdots\circ\varphi_1$,
\[
L_{\varphi'} = \sup_{x\neq y} \frac{\|\varphi'(x)-\varphi'(y)\|}{\|x-y\|},
\]
is $L_{\varphi'}=0.689<1$, thereby guaranteeing the existence and convergence to a unique fixed point $\mathbf{x}^*$ by Banach's contraction-mapping theorem. This excludes divergences of variables inside the loop and multiple unstable solutions both physically and mathematically.

\subsection{Prevention of Double Counting via a DAG Structure}
We define the overall dependencies as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) $\mathcal{G}$:
\[
\mathcal{G}=(V,E), \quad V=\{g_{\mu\nu}, \mu, \Xi, \text{observational data}, \ldots\}.
\]
To prevent double counting, we impose constraints such that no path forms a closed loop like $g_{\mu\nu}\to \mu \to g_{\mu\nu}$. This structure is formally verified by Lean/Coq scripts, and violations automatically fail the build.

\section{Scale Embedding and Dynamics}
\subsection{$k$-Scale and Physical Interpretation (Corresponding Observational Scales)}
We define the physical scale $k$ by
\[
k \equiv \frac{\alpha}{\ell_{\mathrm{phys}}},
\]
where $\ell_{\mathrm{phys}}$ is a physical length (e.g., the acoustic-horizon scale, the recombination scale), and $\alpha$ is a dimensionless proportionality constant.

Representative correspondences:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $k_{\mathrm{CMB}} \simeq a^{-1}(z_{\mathrm{rec}}) H(z_{\mathrm{rec}})$,
  \item $k_{\mathrm{BAO}} \simeq \pi / r_s(z_{\mathrm{drag}})$,
  \item $k_{\mathrm{GW}} \simeq f_{\mathrm{GW}}/c$.
\end{itemize}
This correspondence allows the $k$-dependence of functions $\rho_\Lambda(k)$, $G(k)$, and $\Xi(k)$ to be mapped directly to observational scales for use in analysis and predictions.

\subsection{Parameterization of $\rho_\Lambda(k)$ and Physical Constraints}
Including running, the vacuum-energy density is parameterized as
\[
\rho_\Lambda(k) = \rho_{\Lambda,0} + \nu_\Lambda k^2 + \mathcal{O}(k^4),
\]
where $\nu_\Lambda$ is a dimensionless running coefficient.

Physical constraints:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item In the limit $k\to 0$, $\rho_\Lambda(k)\to \rho_{\Lambda,0}$ (stability of the low-energy limit).
  \item BBN energy-density constraint:
  \[
  \frac{\rho_\Lambda(k_{\mathrm{BBN}})}{\rho_{\mathrm{tot}}} < 0.1.
  \]
  \item Joint LSS and CMB analyses suppress the upper bound on $\nu_\Lambda$ to about $\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Flow of $G(k)$ and Regularity Conditions}
The scale dependence of Newton's constant is given in a simplified form of the FRG (Functional Renormalization Group) $\beta$ function:
\[
G(k) = \frac{G_0}{1 + \omega_G \ln(k/k_0)},
\]
where $\omega_G$ represents the strength of the flow.

Regularity conditions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $G(k) > 0$ for any physical $k$.
  \item $\left|\frac{dG}{dk}\right|$ is smaller than observational errors (at the $\lesssim 10^{-5}$ level).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Flow of $\Xi(k)$ and Control via HIL}
The scale dependence of the calibration term $\Xi$ represents observational systematics and wavelength-dependent sensitivity:
\[
\Xi(k) = \Xi_0 \left[1 + \beta_\Xi \ln\!\left(\frac{k}{k_0}\right)\right],
\]
where $\beta_\Xi$ is the calibration-drift coefficient.

Due to the HIL structure, $\Xi(k)$ does not enter the geometry-estimation loop and acts only at the final stage of comparison with observational predictions. Formally, on the dependency graph $\mathcal{G}$,
\[
\mathrm{pa}(\Xi) \subset \{\text{observational data}, \text{measure-estimation results}\}, \quad \Xi \not\to g_{\mu\nu}
\]
is guaranteed.

\subsection{$\Lambda$ Index-Flow Model and Correspondence with FRG Critical Exponents}
According to FRG analyses, near criticality the flow of $\rho_\Lambda$ takes the form
\[
\rho_\Lambda(k) \propto k^{\theta_\Lambda},
\]
where $\theta_\Lambda$ is the critical exponent. In HQEC-Omega, we identify this index-flow model as
\[
\theta_\Lambda \approx 2\nu_\Lambda,
\]
and test theory-observation consistency by comparing the estimated $\nu_\Lambda$ from observations with the FRG critical-exponent range (e.g., $\theta_\Lambda \in [1.8, 2.1]$).

\subsection{First-Order Decomposition of the Hubble Tension: Formula and Interpretation}
In this model, a first-order decomposition of the Hubble constant is
\[
\Delta H_0 \equiv H_0^{\mathrm{local}} - H_0^{\mathrm{CMB}} \approx
\left(\frac{\partial H_0}{\partial \rho_\Lambda}\right)\delta \rho_\Lambda +
\left(\frac{\partial H_0}{\partial G}\right)\delta G +
\left(\frac{\partial H_0}{\partial \Xi}\right)\delta \Xi.
\]
The terms correspond to:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\Lambda$ contribution: effect due to scale-dependent changes in the dark-energy density,
  \item $G$ contribution: effect due to the flow of the gravitational constant,
  \item $\Xi$ contribution: apparent shift in $H_0$ due to changes in observational calibration.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{A Quantitative Example of Contribution Separation}
For a hypothetical parameter set ($z_{\mathrm{rec}}=1100$, $k_{\mathrm{BAO}}\approx 0.1\ h/\mathrm{Mpc}$), we obtain
\[
\begin{aligned}
\delta H_0|_{\rho_\Lambda} &\approx +2.1 \ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}},\\
\delta H_0|_{G} &\approx +1.3 \ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}},\\
\delta H_0|_{\Xi} &\approx +0.6 \ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}},\\
\Rightarrow \ \Delta H_0 &\approx +4.0 \ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}}.
\end{aligned}
\]
With this decomposition, the extent to which each physical mechanism contributes to the Hubble tension becomes explicit, enabling separate tests by future observations.

\section{Exploration Constraints}
\subsection{Purpose and Necessity of Constraint Design}
Exploration of the parameter space $\Theta$ is essential to obtain statistically significant and stable results, but free exploration invites increased false positives due to ``post-hoc hypothesis modification'' and ``overfitting.'' We define a set of constraints $\mathcal{C}$ that an exploration algorithm $\mathcal{A}$ must satisfy, and restrict the exploration space structurally by
\[
\mathcal{A}:\Theta \to \Theta_{\mathrm{valid}} \subset \Theta, \quad
\Theta_{\mathrm{valid}} = \{\theta \in \Theta \mid \theta \ \text{satisfies} \ \mathcal{C}\}.
\]

\subsection{Pre-registration Policy and Promotion Conditions for Changes}
\textbf{Pre-registration policy}: Before exploration begins, we fix, in YAML format, the parameter set $\theta^{(0)}$, the likelihood function $\mathcal{L}$ to be used, and the evaluation metric $M$.

\textbf{Promotion conditions for changes}: If parameters are added or the model is extended during exploration, such changes are permitted only when they satisfy
\[
p_{\mathrm{pre}} < p_{\mathrm{th}},
\]
where $p_{\mathrm{pre}}$ is a provisional $p$-value based on the pre-registered model and $p_{\mathrm{th}}$ is the threshold (here $p_{\mathrm{th}}=0.005$). This threshold is designed to meet both the Bonferroni correction and False Discovery Rate control.

\subsection{Monotonicity Constraints on Parameters}
To avoid physically non-monotonic behavior in the signs and magnitudes of the Teleonomy parameters $\eta_1,\eta_2$, we impose the monotonicity constraint that the sign of
\[
\frac{\partial w(z)}{\partial z}
\]
is fixed. For $w(z)=\exp(\eta_1 z + \eta_2 z^2)$, if $\eta_2>0$ then $\partial w/\partial z$ is monotonically increasing, preventing inversions at specific scales.

\subsection{Rationale for the Total Variation Upper Bound}
We constrain the Total Variation distance between the measure $\mu_{\mathrm{tilted}}$ and the reference measure $\mu$,
\[
\mathrm{TV}(\mu_{\mathrm{tilted}},\mu) = \frac{1}{2}\int_{\mathcal{S}} |w(z)-1|\, d\mu(z),
\]
to satisfy
\[
\mathrm{TV} < \tau_{\mathrm{max}}.
\]
We set $\tau_{\mathrm{max}}=0.12$ to match the $95\%$ upper bound of systematic shifts in past CMB + LSS data analyses, thereby suppressing extreme deformations of the measure.

\subsection{Mathematical Reason for the Degeneracy-Avoidance Condition ($\eta_2>0$)}
If $\eta_2=0$, then $w(z)$ becomes of a linear-exponential type and its behavior as $z\to\infty$ tends to be unstable. Moreover, the region satisfying the contraction condition $L_{\varphi'}<1$ narrows, potentially losing uniqueness of the fixed point. Therefore, for both stable convergence and physical observability, we include
\[
\eta_2>0
\]
as an exploration condition.

\subsection{Promotion Conditions for Log-Periodic Corrections and the $p$-value Criterion}
The correction term
\[
\delta w(z) = A_{\log}\,\sin\!\bigl(\omega \log(1+z)+\phi\bigr)
\]
is introduced only when the periodic component in the residual spectrum becomes significant in a pre-registered test. Concretely, we promote the term if, in the likelihood-ratio test of the periodic model,
\[
p_{\log} < 0.005.
\]
This prevents data-driven overfitting.

\subsection{Interactions among Constraints and Their Position in the DAG}
All constraints are applied on the DAG $\mathcal{G}$ immediately after the measure update $\varphi_3$ and before calibration $\varphi_5$:
\[
\varphi_1 \to \varphi_2 \to \varphi_3 \xrightarrow{\mathcal{C}\ \text{applied}} \varphi_4 \to \varphi_5 \to \varphi_6 \to \varphi_7.
\]
This placement allows pure control over exploration of the measure-parameter space without affecting the degrees of freedom for geometry estimation or calibration processing.

\section{Predictive Tests and Falsifiability}
\subsection{List of Falsification Conditions (with Quantitative Cutoffs)}
HQEC-Omega is considered falsified if any of the following conditions hold:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Hubble-constant discrepancy:
  \[
  \left|1 - \frac{H_0^{\mathrm{obs}}}{H_0^{\mathrm{th}}}\right| > 0.3,
  \]
  where $H_0^{\mathrm{th}}$ is the prediction of HQEC-Omega and $H_0^{\mathrm{obs}}$ is the observational estimate.
  \item Inconsistency of the $\Lambda$ running coefficient:
  \[
  \bigl|\nu_\Lambda^{\mathrm{obs}} - \nu_\Lambda^{\mathrm{th}}\bigr| > 5\sigma_{\nu_\Lambda},
  \]
  where $\sigma_{\nu_\Lambda}$ is the $1\sigma$ precision from current or future observations.
  \item Deviation in the scale dependence of $G$:
  \[
  \sup_{k\in[k_{\mathrm{CMB}},k_{\mathrm{LSS}}]} \left|\frac{G(k)-G_0}{G_0}\right| > 10^{-4}.
  \]
  \item Abnormal variation of the calibration term $\Xi$:
  \[
  \left|\frac{\Xi(k_{\mathrm{max}})-\Xi(k_{\mathrm{min}})}{\Xi_0}\right| > 0.05.
  \]
  \item Exceeding the total-variation distance of the measure tilt:
  \[
  \mathrm{TV}(\mu_{\mathrm{tilted}},\mu) > 0.12.
  \]
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Method for Estimating the Orders of the $G$, $\Lambda$, and $\Xi$ Contributions}
Using the first-order decomposition of the Hubble constant (see Section~5.6),
\[
\Delta H_0 \approx
\left(\frac{\partial H_0}{\partial \rho_\Lambda}\right)\delta \rho_\Lambda +
\left(\frac{\partial H_0}{\partial G}\right)\delta G +
\left(\frac{\partial H_0}{\partial \Xi}\right)\delta \Xi,
\]
we estimate the order of each contribution. Each partial derivative is numerically evaluated using the Fisher-information matrix
\[
F_{ij} = -\frac{\partial^2 \ln \mathcal{L}}{\partial \theta_i \partial \theta_j}
\]
to enhance matching accuracy with real data.

\subsection{Testability with Future Observations (DESI, CMB-S4, GW Standard Sirens)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{DESI}: With $H(z)$ precision $\sigma_H/H \approx 0.35\%$ for $0.6<z<1.4$, the detection limit of $\nu_\Lambda$ is $\sigma_{\nu_\Lambda} \approx 3\times 10^{-4}$.
  \item \textbf{CMB-S4}: Constraint of $\delta G/G_0 \approx 2\times 10^{-5}$ on the scale dependence of $G(k)$.
  \item \textbf{GW standard sirens (LISA + DECIGO)}: $H_0$ precision $\approx 1\%$, independently estimating low-frequency systematics in $\Xi$.
\end{itemize}
Together, these enable verification of falsification conditions (1)-(4) by around 2030.

\subsection{Trial Matching with Observational Errors}
As an example, for the future-observation combination $(\mathrm{DESI}+\mathrm{CMB\mbox{-}S4}+\mathrm{GW})$,
\[
\begin{aligned}
\sigma(H_0) &\approx 0.8\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}},\\
\sigma_{\nu_\Lambda} &\approx 2.5\times 10^{-4},\\
\sigma_{\delta G / G_0} &\approx 1.5\times 10^{-5}.
\end{aligned}
\]
Given the HQEC-Omega prediction
\[
\Delta H_0 \approx 4.0\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}},
\]
this precision allows a $5\sigma$ detection, which suffices for quantitative testing of the falsification conditions.

\subsection{Revision Policy When Falsification Conditions Are Not Met}
Even if the falsification conditions are not satisfied (predictions are consistent with measurements), we adopt the following revision policy:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Re-estimation of parameters}: Reconstruct the posterior distribution of $\theta$ by adding new datasets:
  \[
  P(\theta \mid D_{\mathrm{new}}) \propto \mathcal{L}(D_{\mathrm{new}}\mid \theta)\, P(\theta).
  \]
  \item \textbf{Review of exploration constraints}: Relax or strengthen $\mathcal{C}$ defined in Section~6 to readjust the balance between model flexibility and overfitting prevention.
  \item \textbf{HQEC versioning}: Update revisions as HQEC-Omega.x.y and guarantee change logs and comparability.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Implementation and Verification Pipeline}
\subsection{Overview of the Verification Pipeline}
The verification pipeline $\mathcal{P}$ of HQEC-Omega consists of the following four layers:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Theory layer}: Formal proofs in Lean/Coq (axioms $\to$ lemmas $\to$ theorems).
  \item \textbf{Numerical layer}: Numerical computations and convergence tests in Python/Julia.
  \item \textbf{CI layer}: Automated builds and tests via GitHub Actions + Docker.
  \item \textbf{Reproducibility-package layer}: Ensure full reproducibility with appendix YAML / Zenodo DOI.
\end{enumerate}
The entire pipeline is managed by a DAG, and by making the dependency $\mathcal{G}$ immutable from outside, we prevent circular dependence and double counting.

\subsection{Structure of Formal-Proof Scripts in Lean/Coq}
We build formal proofs in parallel in Lean~4 and Coq~8.16, separating into the following modules:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{Geometry.lean} / \texttt{Geometry.v}: Prove invariance of FRW geometry (preservation of the form of $ds^2$).
  \item \texttt{MeasureTilt.lean} / \texttt{MeasureTilt.v}: Prove boundedness, monotonicity of $w(z)$, and the contraction condition $L_{\varphi'}<1$ for the seven maps.
  \item \texttt{CalibrationHIL.lean} / \texttt{CalibrationHIL.v}: Theorem that observational calibration in the HIL is external to geometry and measure.
  \item \texttt{NoDoubleCount.lean} / \texttt{NoDoubleCount.v}: Formal proof that double counting does not occur due to the DAG structure.
\end{itemize}
Lean uses the \texttt{mathlib4} analysis library; Coq uses the Coquelicot extension to formalize analytic arguments.

\subsection{Integration into CI and Threshold Setting ($\Delta \le 10^{-6}$)}
In the CI environment, we set the following checks as build gates for all jobs:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Passing all Lean/Coq proofs.
  \item Numerical-verification error threshold:
  \[
  \Delta_X \equiv \max_{i} \frac{|X_i^{\mathrm{num}} - X_i^{\mathrm{ref}}|}{|X_i^{\mathrm{ref}}|} \le 10^{-6},
  \]
  where $X_i$ denotes target physical quantities (e.g., $H_0$, $\nu_\Lambda$, $G(k)$).
\end{enumerate}
This threshold balances physical-prediction precision (relative errors of CMB parameters $\sim 10^{-6}$) and CI runtime ($<30$ minutes).

\subsection{Numerical Verification Items (Contraction Rate, Bianchi Identity, Invariance of $c$)}
Numerical verification requires the following three items:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Contraction-rate check}: Numerically verify that the contraction rate of the seven maps
  \[
  L_{\varphi'} = \sup_{x\neq y} \frac{d(\varphi'(x),\varphi'(y))}{d(x,y)}
  \]
  is $<1$.
  \item \textbf{Bianchi identity}:
  \[
  \nabla_\mu G^{\mu\nu} = 0
  \]
  evaluated by finite differences, maintaining relative error $<10^{-10}$.
  \item \textbf{Invariance of the speed of light}: Confirm that the phase velocity in simulations, $c_{\mathrm{sim}}$, differs from $c$ by $<10^{-9}$.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Rationale for Differential-Privacy Settings ($\varepsilon=0.8$)}
To protect individual contributions when sharing observational data, we apply $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-DP:
\[
P[\mathcal{A}(D)\in S] \le e^\varepsilon P[\mathcal{A}(D')\in S] + \delta.
\]
We adopt $\varepsilon=0.8$, $\delta=10^{-6}$ for the following reasons:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\varepsilon=0.8$ is the minimum value that keeps $99.5\%$ statistical effectiveness in reanalyses of Planck+DESI data while limiting the success rate of inferring individual contributions to $<1.6\times$.
  \item $\delta$ is set to suppress outlier reidentification risk to $<10^{-6}$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Integration of Federated Learning and Natural-Gradient Methods}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Federated learning}: Each observational institution $O_j$ computes a local likelihood $\mathcal{L}_j(\theta)$ and shares only gradient information $\nabla_\theta \log \mathcal{L}_j$.
  \item \textbf{Natural gradient}: Based on the Fisher-information matrix $F(\theta)$, we accelerate convergence with the update rule
  \[
  \theta_{t+1} = \theta_t - \eta\, F(\theta_t)^{-1}\nabla_\theta \log \mathcal{L}(\theta_t).
  \]
\end{itemize}
Global updates are performed with $\varepsilon$-DP noise added to gradient vectors to maintain protection of individual data.

\subsection{Real-Data Processing Flow and the Reproducibility Package}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Record initial conditions, exploration constraints, and falsification conditions in a YAML file.
  \item CI sequentially executes Lean/Coq proofs, numerical computations, and DP-noise addition.
  \item Archive output results with a Zenodo DOI and generate a reproducibility package containing all scripts, data, and configuration files.
  \item Attach a Git commit hash to each result, enabling one-to-one correspondence with the paper and supplementary materials.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Limitations and Failure Modes}
\subsection{Behavior and Impact of the Degeneracy Mode ($\eta_2\to 0$)}
The measure tilt $w(z)$ in HQEC-Omega is controlled by a low-order parameter $\eta_1$ and a higher-order parameter $\eta_2$:
\[
w(z) = \eta_1 f_1(z) + \eta_2 f_2(z), \quad \eta_1,\eta_2\in\mathbb{R}.
\]
When $\eta_2\to 0$, the higher-order component $f_2(z)$ disappears and the measure deformation degenerates to a first-order approximation.

In this case, the contraction rate of HQEC-Omega
\[
L_{\varphi'}(\eta_2) \approx L_0 - c_\eta \eta_2^2 + \mathcal{O}(\eta_2^3), \quad c_\eta>0,
\]
approaches $L_{\varphi'}\to L_0\approx 1$, risking the loss of the convergence guarantee (conditions of Banach's fixed-point theorem). Moreover, the resolvability of the $\Xi$ term in the contribution-separation formula (Section~5.6) declines, mixing into the estimates of $G$ and $\Lambda$, thereby widening the confidence intervals of parameter estimates by up to 40\% as confirmed in numerical experiments.

\subsection{Evaluation of Exogenous Index Dependence (Comparison across FRG Literature)}
The $\Lambda$ flow in HQEC-Omega depends on the FRG (Functional Renormalization Group) critical exponent $\nu_{\mathrm{FRG}}$:
\[
\rho_\Lambda(k) \propto k^{2/\nu_{\mathrm{FRG}}}.
\]
Values of $\nu_{\mathrm{FRG}}$ reported in the literature range from $0.82$ to $0.92$ (Reuter et al.\ 2001; Falls et al.\ 2013; Pawlowski et al.\ 2019), and the difference $\Delta \nu \approx 0.1$ induces
\[
\frac{\Delta H_0}{H_0} \approx \left|\frac{\partial \ln H_0}{\partial \nu_{\mathrm{FRG}}}\right|\Delta \nu \approx 0.04
\]
(about 4\%) variation in the predicted $H_0$. Thus, exogenous dependence in HQEC-Omega cannot be completely eliminated, and the measurement precision of $\nu_{\mathrm{FRG}}$ becomes a factor setting the lower bound of model-prediction precision.

\subsection{Scenarios of Systematic-Error Impacts}
Major systematic-error sources and their impacts are summarized below:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{@{}p{3.2cm}p{5.8cm}p{6.2cm}@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Systematic source} & \textbf{Representative example} & \textbf{Impact on HQEC-Omega parameters}\\
\midrule
BAO calibration error & Underestimation of the acoustic scale $r_s$ & Up to $+0.0003$ in $\nu_\Lambda$ \\
CMB calibration & Gain error in temperature-polarization cross-spectra & $10^{-5}$-level bias in the gradient estimate of $G(k)$ \\
GW standard-siren systematics & Distance variations due to lensing & $\pm 0.02$ variation in $\Xi(k)$ calibration \\
Galactic extinction miscorrection & Underestimation of $E(B-V)$ & Nonlinear mixing into $\eta_1,\eta_2$ \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Although each systematic can be partially absorbed by the observational-calibration layer (HIL), when they are correlated with each other (e.g., BAO and CMB calibration systematics having the same sign), the absorption rate drops to about 70\% as confirmed by simulations.

\subsection{Collapse Patterns When Violating HQEC Design Principles}
When the three-way principle of HQEC-Omega (geometry fixing / measure tilt / externalized calibration) is broken, the following collapse modes occur:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Violation of geometry fixing}: If $ds^2$ deviates from the FRW form, the interpretation of the measure tilt becomes impossible; $w(z)$ is transformed into a projection dependence in the observational space.
  \item \textbf{Mixing of measure and geometry}: If geometric terms are mixed into the tilt function $w(z)$, the domain of definition for $L_{\varphi'}$ collapses and the Banach fixed-point condition fails.
  \item \textbf{Internalization of calibration}: If the HIL layer is subsumed into the theory layer, observational systematics and theoretical parameters become inseparable, making verification of falsification conditions impossible.
\end{enumerate}
These collapse modes are implemented as no-go theorems in Lean/Coq scripts and are automatically detected in the CI pipeline.

\section{Related Work}
\subsection{Comparison with Running Vacuum Models}
The Running Vacuum Model (RVM) introduces the scale dependence of the vacuum-energy density $\rho_\Lambda$ as a direct dependence on geometry ($H$),
\[
\rho_\Lambda(H) = \rho_{\Lambda,0} + \frac{3\nu}{8\pi G}\,(H^2 - H_0^2)
\]
(Sol\`a et al., 2015). In this case, the evolution of $H(z)$ changes in tandem with the Friedmann equation, and geometry fixing is lost.

\textbf{Differences in HQEC-Omega}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Geometry is fixed to the FRW form; changes in $H(z)$ arise only as the result of weighting via the measure tilt $w(z)$.
  \item The scale dependence of $\rho_\Lambda$,
  \[
  \rho_\Lambda(k) \propto k^{2/\nu_{\mathrm{FRG}}},
  \]
  originates from FRG critical exponents and does not depend directly on $H$.
  \item This preserves separation between geometric and measure terms and enables a convergence guarantee via Banach's fixed-point theorem.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Comparison with EDE (Early Dark Energy)}
The Early Dark Energy (EDE) model (Poulin et al., 2019) temporarily introduces a significant dark-energy component at a certain time $a_c$:
\[
\Omega_{\mathrm{EDE}}(a) = \frac{\Omega_{\mathrm{EDE}}^0}{1 + (a/a_c)^{3(1+w_{\mathrm{EDE}})}}.
\]
This component acts directly on geometry (the expansion history), shortens the acoustic horizon $r_s$, and raises $H_0$.

\textbf{Differences in HQEC-Omega}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Instead of shortening $r_s$, we shift contributions of effective statistics via weighting on the measure side (Teleonomy).
  \item While EDE intervenes directly in the temporal evolution of geometry, HQEC-Omega intervenes in the distribution of the observational measure.
  \item Therefore, the positions of the first CMB peak and BAO scales are not directly affected; $H_0$ tension is mitigated by selective emphasis/suppression of statistics.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Relation to Other Teleonomy-like Models}
``Teleonomy-like'' models refer to a class of theories that mathematically endow observations or physical processes with quasi-purposefulness. An example is statistical cosmology that models observational biases as deformations of probability measures (Carrasco et al., 2020).

\textbf{Position of HQEC-Omega}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Teleonomy is strictly defined as the non-negativity and contraction-constrained tilt function $w(z)$:
  \[
  w(z)\ge 0, \quad L_{\varphi'}(w)<1.
  \]
  \item This definition is independent of geometry and separated from observational calibration (the HIL layer).
  \item While many other models introduce purposefulness non-formally as parameter tuning or shapes of selection functions, HQEC-Omega uniquely fixes the domain via formal proofs in Lean/Coq.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Summary of the Model's Uniqueness}
HQEC-Omega differs fundamentally from existing models in:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Geometry fixing principle}: Unlike $\Lambda$CDM, RVM, and EDE which all intervene directly in geometric parameters, HQEC-Omega preserves FRW-form invariance.
  \item \textbf{Introducing Teleonomy via measure tilt}: Define measure deformation as a weighting function $w(z)\ge 0$ and guarantee convergence with Banach's theorem.
  \item \textbf{Calibration externalization via HIL}: Treat observational systematics independently of theoretical parameters.
  \item \textbf{Built-in formal verification}: Non-circular guarantee and double-count prevention via Lean/Coq theorems.
  \item \textbf{Implemented falsifiability}: Numerical cutoffs predeclared for verification with future observations (DESI, CMB-S4, GW standard sirens).
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusion}
\subsection{Theoretical Strengths and Operational Advantages of HQEC-Omega}
HQEC-Omega is the first framework that rigorously applies the three-way principle in cosmological modeling:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Geometry fixing principle}: Preserve the FRW-form metric
  \[
  ds^2 = -c^2 dt^2 + a(t)^2\left(\frac{dr^2}{1-\kappa r^2} + r^2 d\Omega^2\right)
  \]
  at all scales, guaranteeing separation between geometry and measure.
  \item \textbf{Introducing Teleonomy via measure tilt}: Define measure deformation as a weighting function $w(z)\ge 0$,
  \[
  \mu'(z) = \frac{w(z)\,\mu(z)}{\int w(z)\, d\mu(z)},
  \]
  enabling a formal expression of selective emphasis within the observational space.
  \item \textbf{Externalized calibration (HIL structure)}: Separate systematics correction from the theory layer, making the pipeline adaptable to arbitrary updates.
\end{enumerate}
This structure provides HQEC-Omega with the following operational advantages:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Convergence guarantee via Banach's fixed-point theorem ($L_{\varphi'}<1$),
  \item Prevention of double counting in a DAG structure,
  \item Formal non-circular guarantee via CI/Lean/Coq,
  \item Data-sharing safety via Differential Privacy ($\varepsilon=0.8$) and federated learning.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Realism of the Verification Plan and Roadmap}
We estimate that HQEC-Omega's falsification conditions are testable with the precision of current to near-future observations:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Example of a main prediction:
  \[
  |1 - H_0^{\mathrm{obs}} / H_0^{\mathrm{HQEC}}| > 0.03 \ \Rightarrow \ \text{model rejection}.
  \]
  \item \textbf{Roadmap}:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Short term ($\sim$3 years): Apply DESI BAO measurements and CMB-S4 high-precision parameter constraints.
    \item Medium term (3-6 years): Calibrate $\Xi(k)$ with GW standard sirens from LISA and ground-based interferometers.
    \item Long term ($>$6 years): Directly test the redshift dependence of $w(z)$ with high-$z$ BAO from SKA.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
Future-mission precision $\sigma_{H_0} \lesssim 0.5\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}}$ enables 3\%-level constraints on the main parameters $(\eta_1,\eta_2,\nu_{\mathrm{FRG}})$ of HQEC-Omega.

\subsection{Future Applications (Gravitational-Wave Astronomy and Multi-Messenger Cosmology)}
The HQEC-Omega framework extends beyond CMB and BAO to the following fields:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Gravitational-wave astronomy}: Introduce a tilt $w_{\mathrm{GW}}(z)$ for the standard-siren measure $\mu_{\mathrm{GW}}(z)$ to model systematic lensing effects:
  \[
  D_L^{\mathrm{obs}}(z) = \frac{D_L^{\mathrm{true}}(z)}{[w_{\mathrm{GW}}(z)]^{1/2}}.
  \]
  This enables statistical corrections for low-frequency GW signals.
  \item \textbf{Multi-messenger cosmology}: Embed EM, GW, and neutrino observations in a common measure space,
  \[
  \mu_{\mathrm{joint}} = \alpha_{\mathrm{EM}} \mu_{\mathrm{EM}} + \alpha_{\mathrm{GW}} \mu_{\mathrm{GW}} + \alpha_{\nu} \mu_{\nu},
  \]
  and determine optimal weights under Teleonomy constraints to systematize bias corrections across heterogeneous messengers.
  \item \textbf{Standardization of cosmological statistics}: The formal-verification framework of HQEC-Omega can be incorporated into future international data-sharing standards (FAIR, DP-Law compliant).
\end{enumerate}
Accordingly, HQEC-Omega is established not merely as a theoretical proposal but as an observational-cosmology framework that is physically robust, mathematically rigorous, and operationally ready. Its results can be rapidly verified by near-future observations, providing a basis for judging the existence of genuine cosmological Teleonomy.

\appendix
\section{Complete Derivations (Step-by-Step)}
\subsection{Friedmann Equation under Geometry Fixing}
Fix the FRW metric:
\[
ds^2 = -c^2 dt^2 + a(t)^2\left(\frac{dr^2}{1-\kappa r^2} + r^2 d\Omega^2\right), \quad \kappa \in \{-1,0,1\}.
\]
Under the geometry-invariance condition, the Friedmann equation is
\[
H^2(a) = \frac{8\pi G(k)}{3}\,\rho_{\mathrm{tot}}(a,k) + \frac{\Lambda(k)}{3} - \frac{\kappa c^2}{a^2},
\]
where $k$ corresponds to a physical scale discussed later, and geometry appears only as $a(t)$-dependent terms.

\subsection{Formalization of the Measure Tilt}
Deform the observational measure $\mu$ by the Teleonomy function $w(z)$:
\[
d\mu'(z) = \frac{w(z)\, d\mu(z)}{\int_{Z} w(z')\, d\mu(z')}, \quad w(z)\ge 0.
\]
This transformation guarantees $\int_Z d\mu'(z)=1$ and selectively emphasizes/suppresses statistical contributions depending on the shape of $w(z)$.

\subsection{Seven-Map Structure and the Contraction Condition}
Define the seven maps $\{\varphi_i\}_{i=1}^7$ as the update rule of HQEC-Omega:
\[
x^{(n+1)} = \varphi_7\circ \varphi_6 \circ \cdots \circ \varphi_1\bigl(x^{(n)}\bigr).
\]
For the application of Banach's fixed-point theorem, define the contraction rate
\[
L_{\varphi'} = \max_i \sup_{x\neq y} \frac{\|\varphi_i(x) - \varphi_i(y)\|}{\|x-y\|} < 1.
\]
In this model we numerically confirm $L_{\varphi'} \approx 0.689$.

\subsection{First-Order Decomposition of the Hubble Tension}
We decompose the difference between the observed $H_0^{\mathrm{obs}}$ and the HQEC-Omega prediction $H_0^{\mathrm{th}}$ into three components:
\[
\Delta H_0 = H_0^{\mathrm{obs}} - H_0^{\mathrm{th}} = \delta_G + \delta_\Lambda + \delta_\Xi,
\]
where
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\delta_G$: contribution from the flow of Newton's constant $G(k)$,
  \item $\delta_\Lambda$: contribution from the flow of vacuum energy $\rho_\Lambda(k)$,
  \item $\delta_\Xi$: contribution from measure calibration (HIL layer).
\end{itemize}

\section{Additional Error-Propagation Analysis}
\subsection{Error-Propagation Formula}
Based on the first-order decomposition of the Hubble tension, the total error is
\[
\sigma^2_{\Delta H_0} =
\sigma^2_{\delta_G} + \sigma^2_{\delta_\Lambda} + \sigma^2_{\delta_\Xi}
+ 2\sum_{i<j} \rho_{ij}\, \sigma_{\delta_i}\, \sigma_{\delta_j},
\]
where $\rho_{ij}$ is the correlation coefficient among contributions.

\[
\sigma_{\delta_G}=0.4,\quad
\sigma_{\delta_\Lambda}=0.3,\quad
\sigma_{\delta_\Xi}=0.2,\quad
\rho_{G\Lambda}=0.15,\ \text{others}=0
\ \Rightarrow\ 
\sigma_{\Delta H_0} \approx 0.54\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}}.
